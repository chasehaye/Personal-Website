# Personal-Website

My portfolio site was created using only vanilla HTML, CSS, JS
It is a multi page desgin with 4 pages in total
I designed the website with it being mobile first in mind.
When it coems to javascript functionality I created 2 nav bars that both have their own individual submenu nested inside of it with links.
The first nav bar design is for mobile use if the screen is below 991 pixels in total.
The second one is more traditional web design across the top of the page and only shows if the screen is about 991 pixels.
I also created an event listener that closes all submenus if the user resizes the window to avoid any unplesant interactions between the two.
I then created a submenu on my projects page the operates similar to the origianl design which takes the user along the page to nest projects.
On this same page I created a button that pops up at the bottom of the page once the user scrolls down a littloe further than the top. Clicking this button will return the suer back to the top of the page.
